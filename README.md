players start to place X or O first player will always be X and 
any of the players who has three in a row (X or O) will win.
When any of the players win the player's score  increases and Winner or Tie text
will appear. If player is losing the game nothing would show up till the player 
win the game or get more than the other player score.

#technologies used
VS Code,
 JavaScript, 
 HTML, 
 CSS,

 CSS tools for shadow.

JS used to make the game logic and also Jquery so i can have
control on changing some css and html elemnts.
In addtion google font CDN used to change
the font-family in CSS.

#unsolved problems and future 
- Animation.
- Sounds.
- Responsive so it work on phones.
- player vs computer.
Tryed to add some animation on text and background
but did not have the time,So in future some sounds
 and animations will be added.


#solved for the winner
I made an empty array that will take the value of the elemnt id
to place X or O  where it should be then compared the indexes 
inside that array in a function called (check Winner) with if statment.
